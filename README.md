# CompactWooCommStorefrontHeader
Word Press WooCommerce Storefront theme header is re-designed to have a compact look

The WooCommerce store front is good for creating a simple storefront web site to sell products.  I recently designed a web site using it.  However, its header is very bulky.  I tried fine tune the configuration using WordPress Appearances settings. However, the client still not very happy with it.  She wants exactly what she had in her scratch book.  I ended up have to re-design the header.  

Re-design with Storefront theme isn't easy.  It uses Hooks, and functions.  I had to dig into the files in order to find the right files and the right functions.  I had to un-register the default hooks, and register or reconfigure the hooks that I want.  

The repository here is a child theme(obviously, always create and modify the child theme in word press).  Download and add this theme to the Themes folder, and activate this theme in the AppearncesSection of the WordPress admin page.
